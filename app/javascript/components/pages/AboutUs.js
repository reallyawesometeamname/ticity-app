              <p>
                With the current environment, Chuck felt now was a good time to
                learn something new. As a student at the LEARN Academy in San
                Diego, he began studying full-stack software development which
                he feels was a good way to augment embedded software with a
                greater knowledge of applications, servers, databases, and the
                web. Chuck is already an experienced Software Engineer/Manager
                with a demonstrated history of working in both wireless, power,
                and avionics industries. Skilled in Software Design, Device
                Drivers, Embedded Software, and Embedded Systems. Strong
                engineering professional with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.)
                focused in Computer Science from Chapman University.

                Matt is a developer who loves the creativity of the front end
                and logical flow of the backend. He has a strong passion for
                creating eye-pleasing experiences for users through his styling.
                He also has two years of teaching in the Special Education field
                and five years of leadership experience with the Marine Corps.
                When he isnâ€™t grinding away code at his desk you can find him
                making appearances all throughout San Diego as Captain America
                and other characters for charity events.
