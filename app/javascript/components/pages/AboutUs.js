                <h3>Chuck Gilbreth</h3>
                <p>
                  With the current environment, Chuck felt now was a good time
                  to learn something new. As a student at the LEARN Academy in
                  San Diego, he began studying full-stack software development
                  which he feels was a good way to augment embedded software
                  with a greater knowledge of applications, servers, databases,
                  and the web. Chuck is already an experienced Software
                  Engineer/Manager with a demonstrated history of working in
                  both wireless, power, and avionics industries. Skilled in
                  Software Design, Device Drivers, Embedded Software, and
                  Embedded Systems. Strong engineering professional with a
                  Bachelor of Science (B.S.) focused in Computer Science from
                  Chapman University.
